            During my time working at HitFox Group/Finleap, I was the main Frontend developer assigned to the revamp of the Valendo landing page and internal tooling for their agents. Working closely with the designer, I learnt the best practices in producing mobile first interfaces.

            My part in this project has been supporting the designer with the usability and implementing the resulting design following her high fidelity mockups. As a startup with a customer segment composed mainly by 40+ years and with high buying power individuals, the challenge of this design was to convey trust and at the same time elegance. The readability and clarity were two very important factor to take into account after interviewing the users and understanding their physical constraints as eye sight issues. Phone has been pushed as a main way of contacting the company as this was revealed to be the favoured channel of communication of our customers.
