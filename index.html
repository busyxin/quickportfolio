          <p class="site__description">Hi, my name is Chin and these are some of the projects I developed during my Masters studies at the KTH in Stockholm and UTwente in the Netherlands. They are mostly simple UI designed to learn about the foundations of Human-Computer Interaction and different UX aspects. I am including the professional work I developed as a freelancer, mainly the Tech Open Air Conference in Berlin and Talon.One, my former employer with which I worked for as a contractor for half year more in Sweden.</p>
