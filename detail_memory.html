            Long time ago, ancient Romans and Greeks used a mnemonic technique called the Loci Method, also known as the Memory Palace. In this scientific research, we wanted to understand if realism in VR could be used as a parameter to optimize this method.

            With a fellow student, we took the course Research Methodoloy and Scientific Writing as an opportunity to explore an area of common interest: cognition. Many startups nowadays are offering VR for education and learning. From our preliminary research, we found out that VR can be used in the application of the Memory Palace method. A person can become familiar with a place and then store new information in this mind palace and then retrieve it easily by having a mental stroll. We wanted to isolate the variable of "realism" and see the effects that it has in cognition. For this purpose, we used UNITY to develop a virtual environment ressembling a modern apartment and created 2 different fidelities of it. One with enough detail that fingerprints can even be seen on the wine glasses, and the second one with the polygonal mesh exposed, extremely low fi. We conducted experiments where we taught our participants 10 words in Finnish, and then we let them explore the virtual environment for 10 minutes and we would later check the method accuracy. Our initial hypothesis is that the higher resolution and more realistic the environment is, the better can cognition work. The results proved us wrong as the memory performance tended to be better in low resolution. Further experiments shall be conducted with a bigger sample to corroborate this fact.
