            solarisBank is the first German digital bank born as a startup and obtaining the banking license. Currently 3 years active, it raised up to 70m Euros during their series B and the company keeps growing. As part of the launching team, I built their corporate site and back office.

            As their Frontend developer with more visual and usability afinity, I was in charge of developing the corporate page with a talented designer. He experimented with animations as a form of message conveying and interaction, as well as video elements and simple metaphors. I had the occasion to play with more advanced features of CSS3 and HTML5 elements. Besides this project, I worked with other fullstack developers in the inner backoffice UI where the bank accounts can be supervised, audited and managed.
