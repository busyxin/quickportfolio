            For the course of Human-computer Interaction: Principles and Design, we were asked to design an interface reflecting a solution for a niche group of users. Our group got assigned the collective of elite athletes.
            In order to find out more about this group, we did field research in the sports facilities of Bos√∂n, located on the island of Lidingo in Stockholm. There, we had the opportunity to observe the athletes during their training and try to discern common issues.
            During the divergent phase, many ideas came up, ranging from training tracking to postural correctness support using the capacities of the mobile devices. These solutions do exist and they are actually available for the general market. We asked ourselves, what differentiates the professional athletes from normal sport enthusiasts.
            Interviewing many athletes from the Swedish national team revealed their common struggle: sponsorship management.
